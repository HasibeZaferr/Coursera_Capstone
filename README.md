# Battle of the Neighborhood
This project will utilize the location data from Foursquare by making RESTful API calls to the Foursquare API to retrieve data about venues in different neighborhoods around the world. The data are not readily available by scraping web data and parsing HTML code. This project will utilize Python and its pandas library to manipulate data, exploring and analyzing data.
